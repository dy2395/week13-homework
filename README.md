# week13-homework

For this homework we built the back end for an e-commerce site. We used Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. <br/>
- After adding database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, it should be able to connect to a database using Sequelize.<br/>
- You need to run schema in MySQL and then npm seed in the terminal. Then after entering npm start and opening API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, you should see the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. <br/>
- API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia should be able to create, update, and delete data in the database.
